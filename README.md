# Tiny Calculator C++

Tiny Calculator is a C++ file that allows you to use math functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, and the log functions from the command prompt. 

## Installation and How To Use

This section is combined because you will already be in a terminal when cloning the project:
1. Forking from github repository
2. Using command prompt (or your device's equivalent)

### Forking from Repository

In order to this click the fork button on the top right corner of the screen. Then follow this tutorial on how to set up a github project:
[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### Using Command Prompt

(Note: must have `g++` compiler)

1. Put main.cpp, main.hpp, and pi.txt into a local folder of choice
2. Using command prompt navigate to the local folder with the files
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
$ g++ main.cpp -o executable_name_here.exe
$ executable_name_here.exe
```

From here type e to exit the program or press h to look at math operations to use
